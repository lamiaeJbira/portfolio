## Mansuba Project

> A generic board game system inspired by Shatranj and Chinese Checkers.

This project is based on the ancient board game Mansuba, a puzzle-like game that challenges players to win by moving pieces on a board following strict rules. The goal of the project is to create a framework where different types of board games can be played and where various pieces, moves, and win conditions are defined.

### Prerequisites

To begin this project, you will need:

- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection for compiling C programs.
- **Make**: A build tool to compile the project efficiently.
- **Linux Environment**: The project is optimized for development and execution in a Linux system.

### Project Overview

The objective is to develop a framework for a variety of board games where players can move pieces with distinct movement patterns. The primary reference game is based on Chinese Checkers, and the initial milestone includes two players, a simple 2D grid board, and basic move mechanics.

The project is built in incremental achievements. These achievements progressively add more features to the game, such as adding different types of pieces, new movement rules, capture mechanics, and support for multiple players.

### Compilation and Execution

#### Compile the Project:

```bash
make
